# Forest_fire_identification
This project aims to develop an automated forest fire detection system that an real-time video footage from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using Python-based computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system enhances early detection capabilities, enabling rapid response to minimize environmental and economic damage caused by wildfires.
